# ROADMAP


## Interactive Interface (Done)

Interactive interface for more easier use for tasks not used enough often to be remember with alias.  
Use of menu to choose action and search for contacts.


## Autocompletion command

Use clap complettion generation feature to make command line easier.

## TUI

A Terminal User Interface, to let the user have a better view of everything. Not sure I will ever make it because it is low priority.

## GUI 

A good GUI resizable on very diverse screen size/ratio.
